  <div class="card black">
      <div class="card-content">
        <p> In the case that CUCTF 2020 switches to an online infrastructure, all physical event sponsors <i>(Silver, Gold, and Diamond)</i> will: </p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>Have the opportunity to connect with students through Zoom meeting lobbies</li>
          <li>Maintain sponsorship status into the CUCTF 2021 Event</li>
        </ul>
        <p> CU Cyber understands that interacting with students online does not match the value of meeting with students in person. To ensure that your donation gives you your full value, sponsoring organizations will maintain their sponsor status at CUCTF 2021 with no extra cost! </p>
